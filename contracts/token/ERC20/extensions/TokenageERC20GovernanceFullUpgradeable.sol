/**
 * @dev Abstract contract of the ERC20 with some extensions to support signature base operations.
 *
 * Extend this abstract contract if you are creating a specific tokenURI for each ERC20 token and want to
 * use signature base minting and transferring in order to save gas.
 * Before minting there's the possibility of an address with {MINTER_ROLE} role to sign a transaction in order for
 * other user without {MINTER_ROLE} to mint his/her token, thus not obligating the address with minter role to mint
 * every token and spending lots of gas in a single account.
 *
 * For transferring purpose a user with ownership of a token could sign a transfer permission for others so he/she
 * doesn't need to spend gas. This is specially good in case of selling in a marketplace like Tokenage where a
 * marketplace might require to escrow a token and transfer it afterwards to a buyer without a manual intervention
 * of the user in these operations.
